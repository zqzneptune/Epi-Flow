### Helping Us Help You

To resolve your issue as quickly as possible, a clear and informative bug report is essential. When you open an issue, please include the following information:

1.  **A Descriptive Title:** For example, "Pipeline fails during MACS3 step with ATAC-seq data" is much more helpful than "Script error."

2.  **The Exact Command:** Copy and paste the full command you used to run `epi_flow.sh`.

3.  **The Complete Error Message:** Copy the full error message you saw in your terminal. Don't summarize it; the exact wording is often crucial for debugging.

4.  **The Relevant Log File:** The pipeline creates log files for each step in the `logs/` directory. If a specific tool failed (e.g., `bowtie2`), please attach the corresponding log file (e.g., `bowtie2.log`) to your issue.

5.  **Your Environment:** Briefly describe your setup. For example:
    *   "Running in a Conda environment on Ubuntu 22.04."
    *   "Using HPC modules on a SLURM cluster."

Providing this information helps us reproduce the error and find a solution much faster.
